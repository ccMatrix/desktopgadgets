This project will provide help and source code for all Google Desktop gadgets created by me.

The official website for these gadgets is [desktop-gadgets.net](http://www.desktop-gadgets.net).

If you want to contribute to any of the available gadgets, either with your programming skills, ideas or with a translated version please contact me.

Should you decide to use one of my gadgets as a base for your own gadget let me know. I would love to see what you have done with them.

The box on the left contains links to some useful webpages if you are interested in developing gadgets yourself.
