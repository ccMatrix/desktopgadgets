Stephen Roberts|I contend that we are both atheists. I just believe in one fewer god than you do. When you understand why you dismiss all the other possible gods, you will understand why I dismiss yours

Bertrand Russell|And if there were a God, I think it very unlikely that He would have such an uneasy vanity as to be offended by those who doubt His existence 
George Bernard Shaw|The fact that a believer is happier than a skeptic is no more to the point than the fact that a drunken man is happier than a sober one 
Epicurus|Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God? 
Doug McLeod|I still say a church steeple with a lightning rod on top shows a lack of confidence

And if you do any of these ten things, he has a special place, full of fire and smoke and burning and torture and anguish, where he will send you to live and suffer and burn and choke and scream and cry forever and ever 'til the end of time!  ..But He loves you.

Napoleon Bonaparte|Religion is excellent stuff for keeping common people quiet

Russian Proverb|Pray to God, fine; but keep rowing to shore.

Edith Sitwell|I am patient with stupidity, but not with those who are proud of it. 
Donald Morgan|Jesus' last words on the cross, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" hardly seem like the words of a man who planned it that way. It doesn't take Sherlock Holmes to figure there is something wrong here.

Richard Feynman|But I don't have to know an answer. I don't feel frightened by not knowing things, by being lost in the mysterious universe without having any purpose — which is the way it really is, as far as I can tell, possibly. It doesn't frighten me 
Stephen Jay Gould|Creation science has not entered the curriculum for a reason so simple and so basic that we often forget to mention it: because it is false, and because good teachers understand exactly why it is false. What could be more destructive of that most fragile yet most precious commodity in our entire intellectual heritage -- good teaching -- than a bill forcing honorable teachers to sully their sacred trust by granting equal treatment to a doctrine not only known to be false, but calculated to undermine any general understanding of science as an enterprise?
Woody Allen|If God exists, I hope he has a good excuse 
Annie Dillard, 'Pilgrim at Tinker Creek'|Eskimo: "If I did not know about God and sin, would I go to hell?" Priest: "No, not if you did not know." Eskimo: "Then why did you tell me?" 
Unknown|"If god doesn't like the way I live, Let him tell me, not you." 
Richard Dawkins|Religion is unusual among divisible labels in being spectacularly unnecessary. If religious beliefs had any evidence going for them, we might had to respect them in spite of their concomitant unpleasantness. But there is no such evidence. To label people as death-deserving enemies because of disagreements about real world politics is bad enough. To do the same for disagreements about a delusional world inhabited by archangels, demons and imaginary friends is ludicrously tragic.
Carl Sagan|Atheism is more than just the knowledge that gods do not exist, and that religion is either a mistake or a fraud. Atheism is an attitude, a frame of mind that looks at the world objectively, fearlessly, always trying to understand all things as a part of nature

Unknown|Doesn't it bother you that you put more logical thought into choosing a car than you do in choosing a god? 
Peter O\'Toole (The Ruling Class)|Everything is more or less organized matter. To think so is against religion, but I think so just the same. When did I realize I was God? Well, I was praying and I suddenly realized I was talking to myself

Geoff Mather|It's a pity Jesus remained so silent before his accusers. He could have said: "Oh, by the way guys,  no-one should ever kill, torture, maim, burn alive or commit genocide in my name." If he'd been a god he could have saved us all a lot of pain.

As the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion; as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquillity, of Mussulmen; and, as the said States never entered into any war, or act of hostility against any Mahometan nation, it is declared by the parties, that no pretext arising from religious opinions, shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries.This treaty was endorsed by George Washington before he left office.  It was then officially endorsed by John Adams and sent to the senate where it was officially ratified June 10, 1797.

David Attenborough|I often get letters, quite frequently, from people who say how they like the programs a lot, but I never give credit to the almighty power that created nature, to which I reply and say, "Well, it's funny that the people, when they say that this is of the almighty, always quote beautiful things, they always quote orchids and hummingbirds and butterflies and roses." But I always have to think too of a little boy sitting on the banks of a river in west Africa who has a worm boring through his eyeball, turning him blind before he's five years old, and I reply and say, "Well presumably the god you speak about created the worm as well," and now, I find that baffling to credit a merciful god with that action, and therefore it seems to me safer to show things that I know to be truth, truthful and factual, and allow people to make up their own minds about the moralities of this thing, or indeed the theology of this thing."

Bertrand Russell|Many orthodox people speak as though it were the business of sceptics to disprove received dogmas rather than of dogmatists to prove them. This is, of course, a mistake. If I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china teapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit, nobody would be able to disprove my assertion provided I were careful to add that the teapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful telescopes. But if I were to go on to say that, since my assertion cannot be disproved, it is intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it, I should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense. If, however, the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled into the minds of children at school, hesitation to believe in its existence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter to the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the Inquisitor in an earlier time.

It is thus offensive and disgraceful for an unbeliever to hear a Christian talk nonsense about such things, claiming that what he is saying is based in Scripture. We should do all that we can to avoid such an embarrassing situation, which people see as ignorance in the Christian and laugh to scorn.

He does this because his death will, for some or other reason, clear humanity's sin tally (which he, himself is keeping up in heaven). And then after his plans to get himself killed fall into place, he looks around and asks himself why he has abandoned himself?  Is that the basic gist of it?

James Haught|The U.S. has more churchgoing than any other major democracy and it reports much higher rates of murder, rape, robbery, shootings, stabbings, drug use, unwed pregnancy, and the like, as well as occasional tragedies such as those at Waco and Jonestown. There may be no link between the two conditions, but the saturation of religion has failed to prevent the severe crime level. Societies rife with fundamentalism and religious tribalism are prone to sectarian violence. In contrast, England, Scandinavia, Canada, Japan, and such lands have scant churchgoing, yet their people are more inclined to live peaceably, in accord with the social contract. The evidence seems clear: To find living conditions that are safe, decent, orderly, and 'civilized,' avoid places with intense religion.

Blulu|Reply to yourall embarrassing: I (like many atheists) know the bible really well, probably better than you. It is a good read and contains some useful teachings that still apply. However, anyone who says they believe every word of it is either deceiving others or themselves. It contains so many contradictions, and things that nobody, not even you, honestly believes applies anymore. If you Google ‘bible contradictions’ you will find over 1,000,000 entries. Some written by believers trying (and failing) to justify them and some written by atheists like me who know the bible well enough to know that it is very human written and flawed. Either ‘god’s word’ is true or isn’t. If there is just one contradiction in it, this would be enough to discredit it as the foundation of any religion, but actually there are many, perhaps hundreds. Those who justify these contradictions ask us to believe that god changed his mind and his principles as the time progressed – how absurd is that? I’m sorry but what you accuse us of here really applies to you. It is believers who have to twist what they read into something that supports their views. I will stop here, because I know I can never convince you when you are so determined to keep lying to yourself.

Tiberius C. Costea|Logic and reason reject the possibility of the existence of a "spiritual" world.As any educated person (especially in the matters of the brain functions) knows,that the conciousness mainly the self-awareness part of it, is produced by the brain. Self-awareness being described as the exact awareness of the existence of ones self; being aware of ones self at any chosen time of the subject, and being able to produce the awareness in an instant.Or by the decomposion of the brain after the demise of the physical body,any function of the brain dies along with it.Knowing this it would not be possible to be aware of ones self in a so called dimension that does not include any material aspect,(the brain in this particular case)because "The spiritual" as defined by the believers is some sort of dimension that is opossed to the physical world,and does not include the laws of physics nor the most basic natural laws such as space,time,matter,gravity.Even if it would be possible to achieve such futile nonsense, once on the otherside, the first human impulse is the self-positioning of ones self.The first question that rises inside ones head after wakeing up from a deep state of unconciousness is "Where Am I".Ofcourse such question would be nonsense in a world that contains no space; not to mention that an individual needs at least one milisecond to become aware and to ask himself that first positioning question.This would ofcourse require time.But According to the believers this feature is also missing from the "spiritual" world.So as you can see all this is logical and rational scientific thinking that no believer bothers to do for himself.One more proof that reason destroys blind and foolish faith.

Hume|No testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle, unless . . . its falsehood would be more miraculous than the fact which it endeavors to establish. 
David J. Constable|There exists an enigma. Fundamentalists often are against government social programs such as welfare because, in their eyes, they promote a lack of self-accountability. Apparently, they believe in self-sufficiency and personal accountability - both admirable qualities. Why is it then, that when there is a catastrophe or are other crisis, fundamentalists seem to be the first to make the claim that they have handed over the problem to God and He will make things right? Where is the personal accountability, then?
Will|Whenever someone informs me that "Jesus loves you!" I hasten to inform that person that I am not in any way a necrophiliac. 
Socrates:|[In a mock conversation with Jesus]: Is knowledge evil that God would want to keep it from us? Why did God want to keep us from gaining knowledge? Did he want to keep us subservient slaves groveling under his feet? It seems to me that we owe Satan thanks and worship for his help. Satan seems rather like the Titan Prometheus, who in defiance of the orders of the gods brought man the knowledge of fire. For this service to man, Prometheus like Satan was subjected to torment and torture for all eternity. Certainly human life would be worth a great deal less that it is without love, fire and knowledge.

James Madison|"What have been [Christianity’s] fruits? More or less in all places, pride and indolence in the Clergy, ignorance and servility in the laity; in both, superstition, bigotry and persecution.”
Baron von Knifty|Atheists are the true favorites of god, because if god expects his followers to pray and kowtow to him, or follow his commandments and attend rituals, god puts no such requirements on the Atheist, who he also created.

No bell rings in Gods mind and as Jesus walks by they ask him, if he knows the pope and if it's ok to let him in. Jesus has no idea as well and offers to check out that person.

Trevor Anderson|Theist religion is based on where your born. If you're born in America, you'll more than likely be Christian. However were you to be born in any number of other countries, you would more than likely NOT hold those same beliefs. Therefore, theist religion is often held, becuase people just go along with what their parents teach them as a child. Remember: religion is easy when every answer to every logical question is a one word answer, "Faith". Faith to me means "I don't need to know because that's what God tells me."

Dylan J.|Since its origin sometime during the Middle Paleolithic period, religion has been regarded by the common people as true, the wise as false, and the powerful as useful. As scientific discoveries are made that truly explain natural events or phenomena, the god(s) or other mythological justifications for the events become false and ultimately accepted as bogus.  Today several unanswered questions remain. What is the origin of life? What brought into existence all matter? What is beyond the universe? What happens when you die? Theists have filled in answers to these questions of the unknown with more of the unknown which clearly isn’t a very logical procedure. If you really think about all the different types of religions in the world, it seems that God is just a projection of the personal culture of the different regions. However, scattered through today’s world of many deluded minds, millions of people have realized that the truth doesn’t require having any “faith”. Atheists have accepted the unanswered questions as simply unknown thus far, and have not puttied the ridiculous concept of a god over the gaps in our knowledge. People lacking the belief in God share many advantages over religious people. Finding moral values within themselves, discarding the false hope of prayer as an aid to resolving problems, and striving for absolute involvement in life are just three of the many, many reasons an atheistic lifestyle is better for the individual, as well as all of humanity. 	In essence, an atheist’s morality rises from their own thoughts and personal views on issues, rather than the forced perspective of doing what is right for a god. With this freedom, the nonbeliever is allowed to enjoy many aspects of life that are oftentimes difficult or impossible for the religious. Atheists raise freethinking children. They let their children pick a religion, or none. This is usually hard for parents. If a child wanted to be another religion, or even an atheist, it would be devastating to most religious parents. With this acceptance of the individual comes the beauty that an atheist can be friends with everyone without having the thought in the back of their mind that this person's lifestyle may be incompatible due to their personal differences. Atheists have the power to accept people for who they are. Enabling them to enjoy others quirks rather than chastise them for being unique. In addition, atheists can have relationships with people who have alternative lifestyles without feeling like they have to save them from some deity that is going to condemn them for being themselves. After all, if there was a creator, then He has made everyone the way they are! When generosity rises from an atheist, it is out of the pure goodness of their heart. They are not trying to please any higher beings; it’s just something that they feel is the right thing to do.  Being true to oneself is very important to atheists, and it’s clearly a driving force in their ethical decisions.	If I put fourth only minimal effort in writing this essay, would I receive a grade of 100%? What if I prayed every night that I get an A+? Maybe I wouldn’t be given that grade since I don’t believe. Perhaps it’s not part of Gods plan, and goes against His will. Possibly, the answer to my prayer was simply a “no.” Or, it may be that my prayer was too materialistic and self-seeking. Atheists don’t concern themselves with these excuses for why praying doesn’t always work. Atheists know that hoping, wishing and praying does absolutely nothing to help a cause, and the only real way to accomplish something is to put their hands to use instead of clasping them together. When someone denies the possibility of aid from prayer, it empowers them to take responsibility for their own doings, not to rely on help from an ubiquitous creature. If everyone thought that a magical plan was going to happen, no matter what, then why try to prevent the events or make things better? Atheists take comfort in knowing that there is no plan, and that their actions and advances in studies and technology alone, can combat catastrophes or other horrible events that are often instead credited as being the unstoppable “wrath of God.”

Blulu|Miracles are a name that the religious give to coincidental events with, as yet, no natural explanation. As our knowledge of ourselves and our world grows, the number of ‘miracles’ experienced decreases. There was a time when recovering from a cold would be taken as a miracle. If I pray each day for rain, should I count it a miracle when it eventually does? If so, how about the days when it doesn’t rain? If god gets the credit for fulfilling my prayers, then who gets the blame when they go unmet? Believers will respond that god won’t always do what we want, when we want it done. In other words god gets full credit for everything deemed ‘good’ and bears no responsibility for anything deemed ‘not good’. There are people who see themselves like that too. They are arrogant, defensive and they paint their world the way it suits them. Churches and other religious buildings are full of people like that.

Baron von Knifty|Religion: What you don’t see is what you get.Prayer: Getting nothing for something.
Buddha(Kalama Sutta )|Do not believe in anything (simply) because you have heard it. Do not believe in traditions because they have been handed down for many generations. Do not believe in anything because it is spoken and rumoured by many. Do not believe in anything (simply) because it is found written in your religious books. Do not believe in anything merely on the authority of your teachers and elders. But after observation and analysis when you find that anything agrees with reason and is conductive to the good and benefit of one and all then accept it and live up to it.

Marrila M. Ricker (1840-1920)|"If you must believe in anything, believe in yourselves, in your senses, in your minds. To accept a religious creed is to accept another mind in place of your own and generally contrary to your own. When religious belief comes in brains go out"
Baron von Knifty|You’ll get plenty of gods when you believe that a lightening bolt is a spear from an angry higher power, when you believe that earthquakes, floods and  plagues originate from upset boogeymen, or when you believe that a mere human can possess supernatural powers. It might make for fun science fiction but it’s nowhere near the truth.

Baron von Knifty|Blaming famine, disease and terrorism on the sins of abortionists, atheists and gays is like blaming the dog crap on your throw rug to the shit fairy. 
Baron von Knifty|If those Christian and Muslim parents really believe what their religions tell them, then they should kill their newborn babies at birth so they will reach heaven and meet god that much sooner.
Blulu|I am absolutely convinced that there is no god. My experiences, my intelligence, my thought processes and my instincts lead me to this conclusion. Now then, suppose I'm wrong. Would a fair and just god really condemn me for trusting my own judgment? Would he prefer me to pretend to believe when I don't? No, I don't think so. If god exists and what I believe matters to him, then he should really blame himself for not providing sufficiently convincing evidence. When an innocent person is convicted of a crime, one doesn't hold honest jurors accountable. The blame lies with those whose job is was to provide the evidence.

Jakeness|People hate me because I do not believe in the existence of god. I ask, "Where has god profoundly shown you tangible proof?" The believer says, "He gave me my beautiful children." I say, "Actually, your ape-like sex drive, your 23 chromosome equipped sperm, your child's mother's 23 chromosome equipped egg, and the wonders of cellular division created your beautiful children. Dumbass."
Ryan Young|Religion reminds of when I believed in Santa.  That was an absurd thought after the age of 9.
Unknown|“If you have a faith, it is statistically overwhelmingly likely that it is the same faith as your parents and grandparents had. No doubt soaring cathedrals, stirring music, moving stories and parables, help a bit. But by far the most important variable determining your religion is the accident of birth. The convictions that you so passionately believe would have been a completely different, and largely contradictory, set of convictions, if only you had happened to be born in a different place.”
Unknown|I would very much like to know why God sets strict rules and moralities but there is still incest every couple of pages in the Bible.
Baron von Knifty|TRUE: In the Middle Ages the rich used to pay the monks to pray for them because the rich believed the monks had a better connection to god. That’s like hiring someone to take a bath in your place because they look dirtier.

Isaac Asimov Correction!|Should begin with "Properly " and not "Poorly" 
Chris Floyd|Nothing [Bush] does can be challenged on moral grounds, however unethical or evil it might appear, because all of his actions are directed by God. He can twist the truth, oppress the poor, exalt the rich, despoil the earth, ignore the law--and murder children--without the slightest compunction, the briefest moment of doubt or self-reflection, because he believes, he truly believes, that God squats in his brainpan and tells him what to do.
jstep|Richard Dawkins said god makes him uncomfortable, Not me, it"s gods followers the raise the hair on the back of my neck 
Kezrek|Humans are kind in nature, and never consider superhuman forces until they are scared. So when that nature can't be explained, when a rainbow bursts into the sky, their fear turns into conscious thought aroused by curiosity. Those who decide to explore their curiosity will soon discover the antics of the rainbow. Those who stood and feared the phenomenon made distant conclusions, which to this day have ruined humans' kind nature. In conclusion, action makes the human. Stoic ideals make dangerous assumptions.

Kaytea|Name one thing other then the existence of God that we take on blind faith. There's nothing! Not a single thing. Not even the sun rising every day. I know its going to bethere, but thats something i can prove scientifically. Can I prove there is a God? No.You know what faith is? What religion is? It's a cult. Who gives us religion? Our parents brainwash us when we're four or five and most receptive to the fantastical ideas. We're told we have to believe in God, so we do. I'll ask you all again. What else do we believe in with blind faith? Well let me help you out. The last thing you believed in with absolute, unshakable convictionwas... Santa Claus. No matter how impossible it seemed, no matter how much evidence to the contrary, when youwere a child you wanted to believe, so you did. And as rude as the comparison sounds. Itsnot all that different from believing in the existence of God. They both go about their workwithout being seen. They rely heavily on the assistance of mythical creatures-elves in onecase, angels in the other. So how come you all dont believe in Santa now? Well because you grew up and realized how impossible the whole thing was. Santa Claus went from being a fact to being a real good story,one to pass on to your children. The same way your parents told you about God when you werea kid. Cant you see that God is a myth too?

Yet most religious people are convinced that their way is the ONE true way and their god is the ONE true god. God must be pretty stupid to reveal himself in such a confusing way.

Im sure a lot of it all adds up but then so does Stephen Hawkings work. im talking of course of the Bible and many other religous texts. Will people be reading 'star wars' books thousands of years from now and worshiping George Lucas. It certainly wouldn't suprise me. ??If there is a God whats the point of ze great big baffling universe we cant grasp- seems a waste of space(no pun intended) if it dosnt have a devine purpose? Id love to visit the Andromena galaxy but cant excell past the speed of light so ill just look at it and ponder seems pointless really.
Naes Lencalb|Essentialy nobody could possibly determine the existence of God without using that futile and insulting word FAITH which by itself holds a somewhat lack of evidence. Yet nor can you disproove the existance of 'God/s' for that matter without using a word like probability (we know only of science and math that is pretty much our reality), thus atheism in effect is just as ignorant and self-righteous as the degenerate baffons who follow doctrines towards certain God/s.WAKE UP- HAVE A CUP OF COFFEE OR WHATEVER YOUR MORNING TIPPLE IS- HOW ON EARTH (literally) COULD YOU POSSIBLY PROOVE OR DISPROOVE GOD AND REALLY BE SURE OF IT. I do not believe in what you might describe as a conventinal 'God' and certainly do not follow any dogma's or religion i dont even believe in moral truth or ethical justice for that matter. But is it not possible even probable that a higher being of unimaginable, uncomprehendable 'being' (for better word)that is beyond our primitivley pacievable reality or our intricatly vast universe could 'exsist'(whatever that means) why does a 'god' or 'higher entity' have to be labled as part of a religion.I dont know and niether does anyone else. Existance of god?-not even worth answeringAGNOSTICISM NIHILISMIn addition to this utterly pointless rant which indeed it is, at least athiests dont just bend over, they challenge despite of mass confusion. Yet still cannot disproove god to anything little than an idea-well maybe ones of religion ie. Christianity- I do feel people of religious faiths are excrutiatingly nieve.IF you disagree please write something after this post that provokes thought, is challenging and holds some integrable truth I'd genuinely be interested i could be wrong, i might be right but dont give in without a fight-i joke, i joke- i cant fightI feel that i have turned this magnificent resource of credible archive insights into a relentless chatroom-sorry  mr chris beach, all apologiesI really dislike relgion, even if it were for the better of mankind which it almost certainly is not, it disturbs me to think that people would rather have a comfort blanket of denial (faith) rather than facing the sure reality and horror that is life and to have liberty of mind and intelligence. sorry if i have affended i dont want to come across smug although im sure ive succeded in doing so admirablyAGNOSTIC APATHY for the better? smblak12345@aol.com
David Wilkinson|For some faithful folk, religion is like sausage shaped balloon. An argument against a religion is like a finger pressing down on the balloon. No matter where we press, the rest of the balloon may remain inflated, particularly if we just press at random, as the rest of the balloon may absorb the stress. Thus it is necessary to ensure that the religious person is brought to as complete and systematic an understanding of their faithty bubble as possible, if it is to burst.

The only arguement a religous person can make is saying ethier " you can't disprove god" or " your going to hell" over and over again! Right, i cant disprove god, but you cant prove him.

John Bremner|Proof of the non-existence of GodTo most believers god is omniscient and omnipotent. However, there are a few problems with this view that are difficult to surmount. If god is omniscient - all knowing, all seeing, then by definition he knows everything there is to know, past, present and future. By definition, therefore, he cannot learn anything, because to learn something would imply that he did not already know that thing. However, a god who cannot learn is not omnipotent - all powerful, because there is something that he cannot do. If on the other hand, God is capable of learning, he cannot be omniscient, because by definition there must be something that he does not know. Therefore god is not both omnipotent and omniscient. However, this does not necessarily mean that he is not one of these things.  A closer look at these arguments  though, makes it clear that omnipotence includes omniscience - an all powerful god is a god capable of doing anything including knowing things. However, since it has already been established that both qualities cannot coexist in god, there is no omnipotent god.Let P represent omnipotence.Let O represent omniscienceIf P exists, it must include O.P does not include O therefore P does not exist. This leaves only the possibility of God being omniscient. However, A closer look at these arguments again, makes it clear that omniscience includes omnipotence, because an omniscient god is a god that knows everything, including how to make anything happen. However, since it has already been established that both qualities cannot coexist in god, there is no omniscient god.If O exists, it must includes P.O does not include P therefore O does not exist.Hence there is neither an omnipotent god or an omniscient god, and anyone who believes in any current version of God is wrong.

Robert G. Ingersoll|About the Holy Bibleby Robert G. Ingersoll1894**** **** Somebody ought to tell the truth about the Bible. The preachers dare not, because they would be driven from their pulpits. Professors in colleges dare not, because they would lose their salaries. Politicians dare not. They would be defeated. Editors dare not. They would lose subscribers. Merchants dare not, because they might lose customers. Men of fashion dare not, fearing that they would lose caste. Even clerks dare not, because they might be discharged. And so I thought I would do it myself. There are many millions of people who believe the Bible to be the inspired word of God -- millions who think that this book is staff and guide, counselor and consoler; that it fills the present with peace and the future with hope -- millions who believe that it is the fountain of law, Justice and mercy, and that to its wise and benign teachings the world is indebted for its liberty, wealth and civilization -- millions who imagine that this book is a revelation from the wisdom and love of God to the brain and heart of man -- millions who regard this book as a torch that conquers the darkness of death, and pours its radiance on another world -- a world without a tear. They forget its ignorance and savagery, its hatred of liberty, its religious persecution; they remember heaven, but they forget the dungeon of eternal pain. They forget that it imprisons the brain and corrupts the heart. They forget that it is the enemy of intellectual freedom. Liberty is my religion. Liberty of hand and brain -- of thought and labor, liberty is a word hated by kings -- loathed by popes. It is a word that shatters thrones and altars -- that leaves the crowned without subjects, and the outstretched hand of superstition without alms. Liberty is the blossom and fruit of justice -- the perfume of mercy. Liberty is the seed and soil, the air and light, the dew and rain of progress, love and joy. I

We should be afraid of those who struggle to keep the fear of a God in mankind in 20th century. Even their God wont help them when it comes to paying for them

Penn & Teller|The bible contains the equal amount of fac,t history and pizza
Faith Faith Faith|Where thoughtful consideration and scientific inquiry end, faith begins.
Yaz|I don't want to be one of the sheep the "good shepherd" has led off a cliff.
Naes Blacklen|Why did God decide to call Earth, Earth, when 70% of the surface is water and the centre is molten hot iron and nickle.Silly sausage. He must have been tired after making the universe in 7 days. Eventhough if he was all powerfull he could have saved himself some time and done it in under a nano second. Looking back now he must be so embarresed.
Lucifers Dad|God based on religon did not want men to have sex with men, yet puts an erogenous zone up his ass. Surely it would be a land mine or some sort of body modification so man would not get pleasure in anal sex.
Donald DeWayne Woods|It is sometimes better to be a little mad than sad...
Mitch Camrol|Ten thousand years ago jerusalem was sand. Ten thousand years ahead it will be sand. Everything will be sand. Religion is an excuse for keeping peace for people
Robert DesLauriers|If God was in a foxhole,   there wood be no foxhole.
Sam Harris|“Religious moderation is the product of secular knowledge and scriptural ignorance…religious moderation appears to be nothing more than an unwillingness to fully submit to God’s law”
Adolph Hitler|And if there is anything which could demonstrate that we are acting rightly, it is the distress that daily grows. For as a Christian I have also a duty to my own people. And when I look on my people I see them work and work and toil and labor, and at the end of the week they have only for their wages wretchedness and misery. When I go out in the morning and see these men standing in their queues and look into their pinched faces, then I believe I would be no Christian, but a very devil, if I felt no pity for them, if I did not, as did our Lord two thousand years ago, turn against those by whom today this poor people are plundered and exploited.–Adolf Hitler, speech, April 12 1922, published in "New Order"
Baron von Knifty|One little ditty about the Inquisition; very few people were sentenced to be burned at the stake, most were hanged or beheaded. as those were considered a hasher death than burning because the burning person had time to repent–isn’t that the epitome of convoluted logic? Those special people–people the church favored–were sentenced to be burned at the stake, and, get this, sacks of gunpowder were placed around their necks. That way, when the flames reached them, a quicker,  more humane death resulted from the blast. 
Baron von Knifty|God, Ma? God’am dogma!
Brady Begin|A friend of mine (who is Christian) recently told me that the difference between a world with God and a world without is hope and healing. Which I find extremely childish. Saying you need God for hope and healing is the same thing as saying you need a parent to hold your hand and give you a band-aid when you're hurt.
David Wilkinson|The Universal Rule: Universes that cannot exist, do not exist. 
Marin Basarbov 15yrs|So...God created earth?...ok..but now we now it aint just earth but the moon also...what?He created it too? Yeah but according to up-to date researches there is an entire universe out there- yeah..let me guess-god probably created it too?Religion has to change expand and evolve in order to sustain the lies in it.Basicly everything new discovered is immediately claimed and counted as Gods creation...even though we didnt even knew about it
Iron Maiden|You have only one life, and so many things to learn.

Burp|Energy is infinite as it  indestructible, uncreatable. This energy goes, for one, in, out and through forms. As everything is energy, thoughts are also energy, prays are thoughts, but so is stupidity. As there is an infinite supply of energy, there is also an infinite supply or stupidity. Enough for us all. There cannot be a sun with planets revolving around it. There is no such thing as a solid object. There is only the illusion of solid objects. This illusion requires the participation of an observer in order for it to manifest. And then the manifestation is 'all in the mind".
Morse Smith|Muslims claim their religion is about peace to mankind, however, they had no problem forcing their religion on people, sometimes having to kill 'em.
Woody Allen|I do not believe in an afterlife, although I am bringing a change of underwear 
savage beastie|ya ever notice that when you try to debate a christian all they do is say your going to hell? i guess they haven't evolved yet.
anonymous or unknown|If you don't believe in my God, I will shoot you. If I don't believe in your God, you will shoot me. Since when is there an ownership to God?                                                - Peter Nguyen
from Andrew salgado|you should look into Richard Dawkins. he has thousands of really poignany, funny, or scary quotes.
Time|Time is an illusion. A persistent one, but it is one.A. Einstein.Of course this being an illusion of time, also applies to the  alternative versions of 'history', be they of religious nature, atheistic nature, sports nature, economic nature, nation nature, country nature and so on. As histories by their nature are 'time' related.
timo|If the theory of evolution is true. How come there are still religious fanatics? And huh monkeys?
John Ridley|Where would christianity be today if Jesus had smartenend up for the Court case?
Morse Smith|Do you believe in god? Which one? The friend of Moses, the father of Jesus or the mentor of Muhammad? of course there are a lot more religions but these are the "official" ones.
Stephen Colbert|And though I am a committed Christian, I believe that everyone has the right to their own religion, be you Hindu, Jewish or Muslim. I believe there are infinite paths to accepting Jesus Christ as your personal savior.
Samuel Beckett|Words are like unnecessary stain on silence and nothingness. 
NOT Voltaire|"if we believe absurdities, we will commit atrocities" or variations do not appear in any quotation book attributed to Voltaire or anybody else, or on Voltaire websites that I have checked.Quotations are more useful if they are pinned down to a particular work of an author.
Thomas Neubig|When I was seven a nun told me I loved god so much that I would die for him - I left the church. When I was eighteen the recruiting sergeant told me that many have fought and died to keep this country free - so I joined the Army. 
Out there|Neither is there an 'out there', nor an 'in here'. As, in both case the law of conservation of energy and momentum would be breached, if so.This also applies to Roman Catholics, Protestants, Muslims, Christians, Skeptics, Politicians, Businessmen, Soldiers, Airplane Pilots etc. etc.Relax.
Adolph Hitler|Hence today I believe I am acting in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator: by defending myself against the Jew, I am fighting for the work of the Lord 
Dancing Hawk|All you so-called non-believers are heading for a huge wake up call. Hope all you motherfuckers burn in hell, and when you get there say hi to the devil for me, I'm sure I'll be seeing all you fuckers there anyways, heheheheheee
George H.W. Bush|No, I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered as patriots. This is one nation under God.
Lauren-ashley Reimer|number2butthead@hotmail.comWhen you die god will tell you axactly what you have done wrong. Even Satan belives in god. More than anyone I think. I also think that even you can be saved. I am a christian and I love you even though you say you hate my god. My god will send his wrath upon you and when you meet him on judgment day you will believe but it will be too late for your soul. Yes GOD made atheists but he loves them no matter what their choices are. If god had our whole lives planned out for us we would be like little robots. God is the way the truth and the life. This statment is very strong, and so is mine. Listen to it. "JUST AS HE BREATHED THE BREATHE OF LIFE INTO OUR NOSTRILS HE CAN TAKE IT RIGHT OUT AGAIN." We live in fear of our Lord Jesus Christ. God gives us chance after chance after chance but we take it all forgranted and we shouldn't we should love the Lord for the sacrifice he made for us and yet we try to disprove it.(number2butthead@hotmail.com) if you have something of  value to share with me then go ahead. I challenge you to prove me wrong!!!!!I bet I can do it and I'm only 15 yrs. old. You athiests study the bible sooo much more to try and disprove everything. Pray to god and he will be the rock in your life.
